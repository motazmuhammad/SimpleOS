Implementation notes
I have run the accompanied files on MAC osx. For ease of installation I used homebrew. However, a person may decide to compile from scratch if wished
brew install bochs // for installing bochs
brew install qemu  // for installing qemu
for bochs after carefully placing the bochsrc, and boot_sect.bin files in the correct locations one simply run
bochs
then press c it runs and loads when using boot_sect.bin and does not load when using boot_sect_invalid.bin
for qemu one simply types
qemu-system-i386 boot_sect.bin which runs and loads successfuly
or 
qemu-system-i386 boot_sect_invalid.bin  which does not boot.
